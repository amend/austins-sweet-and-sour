Personal project in which I overlaid tweets from the Austin area on a map of Austin. The tweets are categorized by sentiment; happy tweets show up as red, sad tweets show up as blue, and neutral tweets as green.

Update: I have added functionality so that there are four charts containing statistics about tweets from the Austin area.
The charts discuss a sentiment analysis of the tweets and when the tweets were sent. Red means the tweet was catagorized as positive (for example: What a great day), blue as negative, and green as neutral. The last chart contains the 50 most common words used in the tweets.

Hover over marker to see tweet

The tweets have their sentiment classified through two API's I found online (link directly below). For example, if a tweet is "I had a bad day", the sentiment analysis would return "negative", and if a tweet is "I had a great day", the tool would return "positive". Different API's were used for the map and graphs because they were done two years apart.
