Personal project who's purpose is to identify the happiest and saddest spots in Austin. I overlaid tweets from the Austin area on a map of Austin. The tweets are categorized by sentiment: happy tweets show up as red, sad tweets show up as blue, and neutral tweets as green.

There are charts discussing a sentiment analysis of the tweets and they illustrate which time or day is the happiest or saddest in Austin. Red means the tweet was categorized as positive (for example: What a great day), blue as negative, and green as neutral. The last chart contains the 50 most common words used in the tweets.

Hover over marker to see tweet

The tweets have their sentiment classified through two API's I found online (link directly below). For example, if a tweet is "I had a bad day", the sentiment analysis would return "negative", and if a tweet is "I had a great day", the tool would return "positive". Different API's were used for the map and graphs because they were done two years apart.
